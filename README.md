Huzaifa | Security Researcher

ðŸ”’ Security Researcher | Cloud Security | AI in Cybersecurity

Iâ€™m a passionate security researcher specializing in building secure, scalable systems and leveraging AI to enhance cybersecurity solutions. My work focuses on designing robust cloud architectures, conducting threat modeling, and developing machine learning models for threat detection and intrusion prevention. With a strong foundation in AWS, Python, and tools like IriusRisk and Slither, I tackle real-world security challenges, from securing e-commerce platforms to auditing smart contracts.

Key Projects & Skills
Cloud Security: Designed a secure AWS-based architecture for an e-commerce store, achieving zero vulnerabilities through IriusRisk threat modeling, with policies aligned to ISO 27001 and GDPR.

AI in Cybersecurity: Built machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, CNN) for cyber attack classification and anomaly detection using datasets like UNSW-NB15, integrating PCA and clustering techniques.

Penetration Testing: Conducted ethical pentests using Kali Linux, Metasploit, and custom Python scripts to identify vulnerabilities like SSRF and legacy SSH exploits.

Smart Contract Security: Developed Python-based auditing tools for Solidity smart contracts, ensuring secure blockchain applications for tokenization systems.
Technologies: AWS (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, WAF, CloudTrail), Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Slither, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and more.
